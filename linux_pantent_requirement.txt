Hello Phoebe, may I know are there any permanent role that are still available at the moment, especially anything IT related?
As you may tell I'm quite a technical oriented guy that I'm having experience on not only programming, mathematics and machine learning,
but quite a lot of photo and video editing skills as well, which I think it could come handy in advertisement or other 
production works.

To be honest I was thinking of joining a permanent PUK role for a while already, since this is literally the best working experience I had so far,
I mean aside from wfh and flexible working hour itself, the warm and friendly culture is just simply not like any other job I had before,
and this is the environment I really want to work in for a long period. I orignally thought I should be asking near the current project ends,
but after today's meeting I think I should be shy for asking now right?
