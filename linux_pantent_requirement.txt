Hello Phoebe, may I know are there any permanent role that are still available at the moment, especially anything IT related?
As you may tell I'm quite a technical oriented guy that I'm having experience on not only programming, mathematics and machine learning,
but quite a lot of photo and video editing skills as well, which I think it could come handy in advertisement or other 
production works.
